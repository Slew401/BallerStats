1.	Introduction.
It could be argued, now, more than ever, that data is the central pillar on which the modern world rests upon. Everything from critical energy and food systems and supply chains, that keep as warm and fed, to the video games and television shows we consume are created, implemented, and maintained using a data-first approach. The reasons are varied of course: in the case of television, data allows for greater strategic planning, creating experiences which target a key demographic, with a certain spending habit to best extract value, by plying these groups with the shows they want to watch. In the healthcare field, data allows medical personnel to tackle key problems that might lead to policy changes: the battle against obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart diseases are all waged using a data-driven approach: Find connections between certain ailments, cluster effects and propensity to occur due to the demographics of a region. 
The digital advent that has occurred over the last two decades has done nothing but accelerate this process, creating vast repositories of information, mostly without concern for the implications on the assumed right to privacy. The effort to acquire data, especially at the consumer level, has spawned organizations whose entire purpose is the acquisition of individual data, to sell to companies who wish to target consumers with ads based on their taste, conveyed through the information collected by technology and social media sites like Google, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, and so on. And while there is an appropriate concern for the implications of such mass data mining, it can also eb said that the benefits have been immense: the creation and redefinition of entire fields such and the roles within them (Data Scientists, Analysts and Engineers) and the economic benefits and scientific advances that it has conferred being chief amongst them.
There are no fields that hasn’t been altered by the ascent of the big data age: Data in sports has always held intriguing potential, for its ability to look beyond the action on the field and unlock potential within individual players, teams, and organizations with the long-term goal of achieving greater successes, building dynasties, or even returning to relevance. Some Basketball teams within the National Basketball Association, over the course of the last two decades have taken it upon themselves to adopt an increasingly data-driven and statistical approach to the game of basketball, innovations made possible by new innovations in computer vision, software, and hardware engineering. Franchises within the league have taken it upon themselves to building new software platforms that take the wealth of visual and numerical data generated to build new models that have informed coaching decisions. 
Principle examples of this mode of thinking within the league have been championed by the San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, moving away from a heavier isolation and post-game heavy style of offense, to 3-and-out, rim running style prioritizing 3-point shooting as it has a higher expected value per attempt, and close range lay ups for higher frequency of point generation and second chance scoring opportunities. These insights were made dude to the new statistical approach of viewing the game whereas prior generations of coaches and players relied on the individual talents of star teammates and direct coach-led offensive schemes to generate scoring opportunities.
All these innovations in sports (In our case the game of basketball) are possible to a mix of hardware and software innovations that have taken the great many tables of data produced by scorekeepers over the history of the game, to provide tangible insights to drive the NBA forward. For this thesis, I have looked at the tools, websites, and software available to NBA fans who might lack the analytical or statistical skill to breakdown tables or lack of access to the same software that NBA franchise use to create their insights.
1.1.	 Aims and Objectives.
The goal of this projects is to create an MVP (minimum viable product) web application with modules capable of:
•	loading information about NBA players and teams
•	dynamically generating sortable tables of basketball statistics
•	Allowing these tables to be used to create Data visualisations
•	These visualisations need to be saveable to a user account for further editing or downloadable to Hard disk.
•	This Functionality necessitates the creation of a login system to allow enable the ability to edit and retrieve visualisations created. 
Achieving this would require a comprehensive review of the various Software tools available to us: Programming languages, web frameworks and third-party application programming interfaces (APIs).  The MVP is the lowest level deliverable required to achieve some the desired goal of allowing users to create visualisations on basketball statistics. However there also exist some higher-level goals for this project:
•	The creation of a statistical engine on the web platform to conduct various statistical tests on the Data.
•	ELO-style rankings of team dependent on past performance.




 
2.	Background and Context
Prior to any discussion or consensus on the development of the application, its important we ground ourselves in the background of the NBA, its history, the use of statistics and data over the course of said history. Its also important to note the effect data and its visualisation has regarding the storytelling within the confines of the NBA. Furthermore, its crucial to understand the user of this app and the state of the field regarding the other tools and websites that may or may not facilitate some of the functionality that our application strives to accomplish. 
2.1.	The User
There is significant importance in creating an application that suits the needs of its users, however there is some base knowledge of the game of basketball required to fully appreciate the use case for this application. Therefore, this isn’t an app made for the public, but those with a slightly more nuanced view of the game, starting with the more casual fans to those enthusiasts with a desire for a more analytical understanding of the game of basketball, creating, and forming narratives from the data and visualisations created within the application. These fans can be found in great multitude on the internet, frequenting forums, and chat rooms, connecting with each other from across the world, a testament to the global reach and appeal of the NBA. One of the largest online communities in which basketball debate takes place is the Reddit community r/NBA. Reddit, one of the most visited websites in the world, has many community subreddits, catering to the many interests’ people have, with the NBA subreddit being the second most subscribed to sports subreddit, numbering 4 million with 10s of thousands of daily readers. Online engagement with these fans and NBA watchers is the demographic that would best represent the type of user the application is targeted at. 
 
2.2.	Evolution of the NBA. 
The NBA has evolved drastically from its origins in the 1940s, and with the progression of time has seen increasing sophistication in all aspects, from on-court play, game management, personnel training, valuations. If the NBA history could be divided into historical segments, then its most likely the following: the pre-Shot Clock era, the classical era, and the modern age. The classical era encompasses several key innovations that led to the

1.	Introduction.
It could be argued, now, more than ever, that data is the central pillar on which the modern world rests upon. Everything from critical energy and food systems and supply chains, that keep as warm and fed, to the video games and television shows we consume are created, implemented, and maintained using a data-first approach. The reasons are varied of course: in the case of television, data allows for greater strategic planning, creating experiences which target a key demographic, with a certain spending habit to best extract value, by plying these groups with the shows they want to watch. In the healthcare field, data allows medical personnel to tackle key problems that might lead to policy changes: the battle against obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart diseases are all waged using a data-driven approach: Find connections between certain ailments, cluster effects and propensity to occur due to the demographics of a region. 
The digital advent that has occurred over the last two decades has done nothing but accelerate this process, creating vast repositories of information, mostly without concern for the implications on the assumed right to privacy. The effort to acquire data, especially at the consumer level, has spawned organizations whose entire purpose is the acquisition of individual data, to sell to companies who wish to target consumers with ads based on their taste, conveyed through the information collected by technology and social media sites like Google, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, and so on. And while there is an appropriate concern for the implications of such mass data mining, it can also eb said that the benefits have been immense: the creation and redefinition of entire fields such and the roles within them (Data Scientists, Analysts and Engineers) and the economic benefits and scientific advances that it has conferred being chief amongst them.
There are no fields that hasn’t been altered by the ascent of the big data age: Data in sports has always held intriguing potential, for its ability to look beyond the action on the field and unlock potential within individual players, teams, and organizations with the long-term goal of achieving greater successes, building dynasties, or even returning to relevance. Some Basketball teams within the National Basketball Association, over the course of the last two decades have taken it upon themselves to adopt an increasingly data-driven and statistical approach to the game of basketball, innovations made possible by new innovations in computer vision, software, and hardware engineering. Franchises within the league have taken it upon themselves to building new software platforms that take the wealth of visual and numerical data generated to build new models that have informed coaching decisions. 
Principle examples of this mode of thinking within the league have been championed by the San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, moving away from a heavier isolation and post-game heavy style of offense, to 3-and-out, rim running style prioritizing 3-point shooting as it has a higher expected value per attempt, and close range lay ups for higher frequency of point generation and second chance scoring opportunities. These insights were made dude to the new statistical approach of viewing the game whereas prior generations of coaches and players relied on the individual talents of star teammates and direct coach-led offensive schemes to generate scoring opportunities.
All these innovations in sports (In our case the game of basketball) are possible to a mix of hardware and software innovations that have taken the great many tables of data produced by scorekeepers over the history of the game, to provide tangible insights to drive the NBA forward. For this thesis, I have looked at the tools, websites, and software available to NBA fans who might lack the analytical or statistical skill to breakdown tables or lack of access to the same software that NBA franchise use to create their insights.
1.1.	 Aims and Objectives.
The goal of this projects is to create an MVP (minimum viable product) web application with modules capable of:
•	loading information about NBA players and teams
•	dynamically generating sortable tables of basketball statistics
•	Allowing these tables to be used to create Data visualisations
•	These visualisations need to be saveable to a user account for further editing or downloadable to Hard disk.
•	This Functionality necessitates the creation of a login system to allow enable the ability to edit and retrieve visualisations created. 
Achieving this would require a comprehensive review of the various Software tools available to us: Programming languages, web frameworks and third-party application programming interfaces (APIs).  The MVP is the lowest level deliverable required to achieve some the desired goal of allowing users to create visualisations on basketball statistics. However there also exist some higher-level goals for this project:
•	The creation of a statistical engine on the web platform to conduct various statistical tests on the Data.
•	Animation of Play-by-Play and Second Spectrum Data, visualising game action that leads to scoring events. 




 
2.	Background and Context
Prior to any discussion or consensus on the development of the application, its important we ground ourselves in the historical background of the NBA and the use of statistics and data over the course of said history. Its also important to note the effect data and its visualisation has regarding the storytelling within the confines of the NBA. Furthermore, its crucial to understand the user of this app and the state of the field regarding the other tools and websites that may or may not facilitate some of the functionality that our application strives to accomplish. 
2.1.	The User
There is significant importance in creating an application that suits the needs of its users, however there is some base knowledge of the game of basketball required to fully appreciate the use case for this application. Therefore, this isn’t an app made for the public, but those with a slightly more nuanced view of the game, starting with the more casual fans to those enthusiasts with a desire for a more analytical understanding of the game of basketball, creating, and forming narratives from the data and visualisations created within the application. These fans can be found in great multitude on the internet, frequenting forums, and chat rooms, connecting with each other from across the world, a testament to the global reach and appeal of the NBA. One of the largest online communities in which basketball debate takes place is the Reddit community r/NBA. Reddit, one of the most visited websites in the world, has many community subreddits, catering to the many interests’ people have, with the NBA subreddit being the second most subscribed to sports subreddit, numbering 4 million with 10s of thousands of daily readers. Online engagement with these fans and NBA watchers is the demographic that would best represent the type of user the application is targeted at. 
 
2.2.	Context on the NBA
The NBA, if anything, could be considered a game of superstars. In few other team games is it possible for one star to lift their team from the doldrums of mediocrity to championship heights. There are palpable effects on stadium income and game attendance when a superstar is present vs when it’s absent, Kaplan estimates a 7.25% decrease in ticket prices, which in the case of an injured star, is a loss that can compound over the course of a season resulting in ticket revenue losses in the millions. 
Therefore, regardless of the various evolutions that have occurred since the NBA’s beginnings, from the increasing sophistication of on-court play, rule changes, game management, personnel training, and monetary valuations, the adage that basketball is a game of superstars holds true. It's through this veneer that we can divide the eras of the sport, and how the analysis of basketball has changed as a result. It’s important to understand the history of the NBA to some extent because it best explains 


2.2.1.	The Classical Era
The early era of the NBA could be counted as a period encompassing the founding of the NBA to the establishment of the three-point line. This was invariably the era of the big men: Towering centers who ruled the game from the post or under the basket. Arguably the leagues first true superstar, George Mikan dominated the earliest era, towering over his competition and leading his franchise, the Minneapolis Lakers, to five championships in 6 seasons, the leagues first dynasty. Bill Russell was the leader and defensive anchor of the greatest dynasty in sports history winning 11 championships from 1956 to 1969 and 5 Most Valuable Player awards during that Span. Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, immense dynamos on offense and defence, setting records that stand till this day. While there was no shortage of excellent perimeter guards or forwards such as Oscar Robertson, Elgin Baylor and Jerry West, all hall of famers and NBA legends, this was in arguably the era of big bruising 7-foot players. This fact is represented in the awards handed out during the classical era: from its inception to 1979 the NBA’s MVP Award was awarded to a center 20 times, whereas guards and forwards combined for 4 during that same span. 
It’s in this era where we can see the effect a superstar can have on league policy. Mikan’s overall greatness forced rule changes that helped define the current state of the game, Firstly the advent of the shot clock in the aftermath of the Minneapolis Lakers versus Fort Wayne Pistons in 1950 led to the lowest scoring game in league history. The 24-second shot clock was an innovation that led to faster pace of play. The other innovation that could be attributed to the dominance of superstars is the creation of the “key”, the expanding the space around the hoop, drawing it out further to limit the scoring potential of post dominant players like Chamberlain, Mikan and Russell. Goldsberry directly attributes the current lane size to Chamberlain, as well as the concept of “offensive goaltending” and free-throw rules. 
While the classic era laid down the foundation for the current game regarding ruleset and player impact, it was a rather weak time for the games statistical timing. The game only officially counted core stats, points, total rebounds, assists, field goals attempted and made, free throws attempted and made as well as personal fouls. Blocks and steals weren’t counted until the 1973-74 season, the 28th in NBA history. Advanced statistics and analysis weren’t yet in vogue. 

2.2.2.	The Modern Game
The advent of the three-point line, a holdover from the American Basketball Association (ABA) which had recently merged with the rest of the NBA, marks the dawn of the games modern age. While all save the most legendary players of the classical era have had their careers diminished by time, its from this point forward that the NBA’s superstars become cultural mainstays. This era saw the rivalry between Erving “Magic” Johnson and Larry Bird redefine the NBA of the 80s, against the backdrop of racial tension in America, and reintroduce the game to America, after 70s troubled by on-court violence, start-up leagues and drug issues. The 80s also introduced Michael Jordan, drafted with the second pick to the Chicago Bulls, who in the 90s would become the greatest of all time leading his Bulls dynasty to 6 NBA Championships in 8 attempts. Other notable superstars during the modern period would include Tim Duncan, Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Lebron James and Dirk Nowitzki all of whom would emerge in the later 90s and early 2000s. This period saw the intense internationalisation of the game, and an increase global appeal, driven again by the superstars of the league. This era sees the acceleration of the stylistic shift induced by the creation of the three-point line, moving away from under-the-basket, post centric style, allowing smaller and more ranged based players to shine, utilizing mid-range and three-point shots. 

2.3.	Development of the Analytics Field in Basketball  
While advanced analytical perspectives emerged over the course of NBA history, the movement as we know it was deeply influenced by developments made in baseball, the field of sabermetrics and by the Oakland Athletics, a team that ushered in a data driven approach to their own game, leading to a record 102-win season in 2002 one of the lowest salaries in baseball, by picking up undervalued and underutilized players. Terner notes baseball’s owns sabermetric approach to constructing a team was crucial to the early work on basketball metrics written in the early 2000s. 
Dean Oliver’s Basketball on paper initially moved the needle away from per game statistics to that of a pace-oriented approach, how much could be accomplished in a set number of possessions, or set number of minutes, such as per 50 possessions of per 36 minutes. Oliver also pioneered the four factors: data driven axioms that correlate to a higher chance of winning. He created values such as turnover rate, effective field goal, offensive rebounding rate and free throw rates, which all trend higher on winning teams, and applied relative weights on each of the factors so they can a raw percentage chance of determining success. These factors are used by team front offices to determine relative performance against opponents, and as part of drafting strategies. 
 Another early pioneer, John Hollinger, introduced a new statistic that sought to estimates a player overall impact on the game. Player Efficiency Rating (PER), a metric that takes advantage of every variable in the boxscore to estimate players effectiveness. This was first of an emerging group of advanced statistics that seek to measure the overall player impact and efficiency, refining the methodology to resolve perceived flaws in pervious versions of prior performance statistics. By 2009, there was a consensus around the NBA that deemed that better tools where needed for cogent analysis of players whose boxscore stats, and hence boxscore-derived analytics where subpar, yet held significant influence over the outcomes of games played. This realisation helped speed up the development on team statistical departments when Roland Beech, a stats guru 
 Examples of the increasing growth of the NBA analytics movement include the emergence of new personalities such as Ben Taylor, author of Thinking Basketball, Kirk Goldsberry, NBA Analyst and author of Sprawlball. 
Beyond the numerical and statistical advances made over the earlier parts of the 2000s, the single largest driving force of the “analytics movement” is the dawn of player positional tracking and the creation of play-by-play data derived from inputs from player tracking cameras. The NBA was the first sports league to include SportVU cameras in each of their stadiums (Post-2016 the NBA has since transitioned to Second Spectrum). The effect of this drove demand for data professionals to create new insights into offensive and defensive possessions, team flow and on-court tactical strategies. 
The biggest effect of the data revolution has been an immense acceleration of the stylistic shift mentioned in 2.2.2. Teams like the “7-Second or less” Phoenix Suns and the 2013-14 San Antonio Spurs where early signifiers of the move away from post focused play into the more pass first, 3 point or layup oriented up-tempo offense. But the team who have perhaps benefitted the most from analytic-driven approach to basketball is the James Harden era Houston Rockets, whom, led by an early advocate of analytics in General Manager Daryl Morey, saw an era of consistent competitiveness, historic and record-breaking offensive production, and personal success for James Harden, culminating in the 2018 Most Valuable Player. 

2.4.	Project Uniqueness and Existing Applications
The idea of a sports-data website or app is not unique, especially in sport as popular as basketball. It’s something that’s been done to varying degrees of depth and professionalism. Seeing as there are two aspects to this project, the gathering and presentation of raw data, and that data’s visualisation and analysis, it stands that we must evaluate the state of the art of basketball applications to determine whether anything new is being proposed by building this application. The first aspect, the creation of tabular data regarding NBA statistics is common and well operated. Arguably the most important of these websites is the official NBA Statistics page. There we can find tables of data for every player, team and game reaching back to the origin of the NBA. These tables exist for both the basic and advanced stats generated by NBA play as well as shot location data that’s used to build its patented shot charts. Another example of this type of website is basketball-reference.com, sourcing its initial data from sport data APIS like SportRadar. It too provides the same view of data as the official NBA stats page, tabulated, here however the data is exportable in a .csv format for those with a deeper understanding of programs like Excel to build out graphs and tables. 
While there are other smaller applications that serve the purpose that both these two major sites represent or are equipped within a degree more of functionality (theScore also takes account of betting lines and digital communication between fans during live games) the second major section that our app represents, the visualisation and analysis of data is far less common. From a purely software-based perspective, there are few applications or websites freely open to consumers that over anything other than surface level comparison between player data and teams, and outside of shot charts, programmatically create visualisations of this data for consumption. Visualisations regarding NBA statistics are still mostly created outside of a web application using Excel, R, Python and Stata or some form of proprietary software not available to the average fan. This absence of easily accessible data is compounded by issues like the lack of official documentation of the official NBA APIs (stats.nba.com or data.nba.net) or lack of personal access to SportsVU or Second Spectrum visual data that records NBA player actions of in the court. 
As such, the design space that this app is operating in is to create NBA data visualisations of player and franchise statistics using a web-based platform, is relatively unique even if it contains elements of other websites such as tables to select data for use or shot chart generation for export. Furthermore, the two major sites we looked at don’t offer the login/graph load and save functionality that is being constructed within our application.
